# Stock Prediction using LSTM and MRF models

![Stock Market Image](/images/stock-market.jpg)

## Description

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) models to predict stock prices based on historical data. The dataset used is the [Kaggle S&P 500 stock data](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500) which contains historical stock prices for companies in the S&P 500 index.

## Features

- LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data
- MRF model to predict stock prices based on correlations between stock prices
- Comparison between LSTM and MRF models
- Visualization of stock price predictions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock_Prediction.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the `Stock_Prediction.ipynb` notebook to train and test the LSTM model.
2.Use the Dataset from the kaggle
